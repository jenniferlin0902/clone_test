3. Find a file in the directory /etc on your computer; send us the name of the file and the number of bytes contained in that file. How many files and directories are contained in /etc? Include the commands you used to answer these questions.

cd .. (to go out of cs107e_home)
ls (to scroll through)
cd /etc (to go into /etc)
ls | wc -l (find number of files = 91)
echo */ | wc (find number of directories = 21)
wc -c < syslog.conf (96 bytes)

Number of files = 91
Number of directories = 21
Name of file: syslog.conf
Number of bytes: 96
